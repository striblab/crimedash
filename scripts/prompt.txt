Give me an R function named nibrs

1. Downloads files from these URLs to '/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/nibrs':

https://cde.state.mn.us/DownloadData/OffenseCountyMunicipalByAgencyDownloadData?ReportYear=2021
https://cde.state.mn.us/DownloadData/OffenseCountyMunicipalByAgencyDownloadData?ReportYear=2022
https://cde.state.mn.us/DownloadData/OffenseCountyMunicipalByAgencyDownloadData?ReportYear=2023
https://cde.state.mn.us/DownloadData/OffenseCountyMunicipalByAgencyDownloadData?ReportYear=2024
https://cde.state.mn.us/DownloadData/OffenseCountyMunicipalByAgencyDownloadData?ReportYear=2025


2. Replace '?' and '=' with '_' in the filename

3. Appends an .xlsx extension to each file

4. Then adds a "year" column to each Excel file that populates each row with the given year

5. Then combines all the Excel files into one Excel file called NIBRS.CSV (the columns are the same in each, stored in the first row of each)

6. Columns 7-58 need to be formatted as numbers, the rest can be text

7. Keeps the individual Excel files too, don't delete them


Then I need an R function called suburbs that takes the combined Excel file NIBRS.CSV created above and extracts data by the "County" column for the following counties and saves new CSV files to the given folder:


County = Hennepin saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/hennepin
County = Anoka saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/anoka
County = Dakota saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/dakota
County = Ramsey saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/ramsey
County = Carver saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/Carver
County = Scott saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/scott
County = Washington saves to /Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/washington


Then I need a function called stpaul that does the same, except for "Agency Name" = "St Paul Police Dept" and saves to "/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/stpn"


ADDENDUM

Now I need a function that takes the following CSV files that:

Filters for the field Statistic = "Actual"

/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/suba/NIBRS_Anoka.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subw/NIBRS_Carver.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subc/NIBRS_Dakota.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subd/NIBRS_Hennepin.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subh/NIBRS_Ramsey.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subr/NIBRS_Scott.csv
/Users/hargaja/Desktop/workspace/redboard/20240428-crimedash/store/subs/NIBRS_Washington.csv

And save the new files to their respective folders as NIBRS_[countyname]_actual.csv
